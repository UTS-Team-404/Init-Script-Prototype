## quick script to first set up a new device

This script will have an executable that will automatically update the rc.local file with the commands to automatically download updates from your github repo and make then run at launch (hopefully lmao).

Only run this script once, i dont have any sort of override or checker so be careful. i can make a simple init clearer so that you can wipe the rc.local and try again but that doesnt exist atm. if you want to run it again youll have to manually edit the rc.local file and change it.

todo:
  - incorporate custom splashscreen setup
  - incorporate networkmanager config of managed mode on wifi adapter
